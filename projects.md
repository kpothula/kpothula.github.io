# Experimental Projects ðŸš§

Here are some of the ongoing and exploratory projects I'm working on:

## Browser-based Policy Q&A Agent

A lightweight Q&A system for internal policy documents, running locally with open-source LLMs and ChromaDB.

- Technologies: ChromaDB, Python, Mini LLM, Ubuntu Server Pro
- Features: Fast querying, private deployment, CI/CD integration

## Architecture-as-Code CI/CD Toolkit

Toolkit to turn architecture practices into programmable, repeatable pipelines.

- Tools: Wardley Maps, Markdown, GitHub Actions
- Goal: Improve architecture traceability and continuous validation

## Local LLM Playground

Experimenting with different open-source LLMs and comparing performance on local machines.

- Focus: Fine-tuning, latency testing, local inferencing

## Interactive Wardley Mapping Interface

A visual editor to create and annotate Wardley Maps with drag-and-drop capabilities.

- Tools: React, D3.js, Mermaid.js
- Goal: Collaborative decision-making and strategic clarity

## AI-augmented Architecture Assistant

A prototype assistant that helps generate architecture diagrams and suggestions based on input requirements.

- Technologies: OpenAI API, Natural Language Processing
- Goal: Bridge the gap between architectural intent and documentation
